In many part of the worlds, two citizens who love each other and who whish to make a public declaration of their mutual love through the ceremony of marriage may be prohibited to do so, solely on the basis of their gender, no other reason, it not because of their ethnicity, their religion, their language... simply because of their gender. This is the state of the law in many countries and this means in a way that, under these laws, LGBT adults do not have as regular persons.<br>In 2013, Pew Research Center made a survey, where about 2000 LGBT adults where polled online on the question &quot;why get married ?&quot;. To the answers &quot;Love&quot;, &quot;Companionship&quot; and &quot;Making a life long commitement&quot;, the proportion of answers where about the same between the general public and LGTB adults. The difference can be seen on the other subjects such as &quot;Financial stability&quot;, &quot;Having children&quot;, &quot;Having a relationship recognized in a religious ceremony&quot; <u>and</u> &quot;for legal rights and benefits&quot; where 46% of LGBT adult voted that the legal rights and benefits ensuing marriage were very important, unlike the general public who only voted at 23% on this issue. These numbers bring to the table yet again the very important issue that administratively, LGBT adults do not yet have exactly the same rights as the general public.<br>Society currenty craves for equality, and prohibiting same-sex marriage is simply discrimination. Thank you for your attention<br><br><u>Argument Mingliang:</u> Same-sex marriage is a big step toward equality<br><br>In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court voted five to four to rule that the Constitution guarantees the right of gays and lesbians to marry and that local governments (including state governments) may not continue to ban same-sex marriage.<br><br>There is no more beautiful and profound form of union in the world than marriage, as it symbolizes the highest level of love, loyalty, devotion, sacrifice and family. In forming a marital relationship, both individuals become a deeper being than they are in themselves. As some of the litigants in previous cases have indicated, marriage represents a love that can transcend even life and death. To say that they do not respect the definition of marriage would be to misunderstand them. Their desire is to find their own belonging in marriage, because they understand and respect it so well. They simply do not want to be excluded from one of the oldest institutions of human civilization, and do not want to end up alone in condemnation. They seek equality and dignity in the law, and the house gives them that right.<br><br><u>Argument Ying:&nbsp; </u>Same-sex marriage makes a big contribution to public health.<br><br>There has existed a substantial mental health gap in sexual orientation that may be attributed to either actual or perceived discrimination against sexual minorities. For a long time, homosexuality was considered to be a disease rather than a way of life. The World Health Organization, for example, published the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems in 1948, in which homosexuality was classified as a mental disorder. Due to discrimination and unfair treatment, sexual minorities may have suffered more from mental health problems than heterosexuals. However, opinions about same-sex relationships have been gradually evolving. Same-sex marriage legalisation is a typical anti-discrimination policy to remove discrimination against sexual minorities by providing them with marriage equality. After the legalisation of same-sex marriage, there is less discrimination, thus there is less mental issues.&nbsp;<br><br>There are considerable mental health conferred on those in the fortunate position of being able to marry legally. And there are associated deleterious impacts of being denied this opportunity.In 2009, the American Medical Association officially recognised that excluding sexual minorities from marriage was significantly contributing to the overall poor health among same-sex households compared to heterosexual households. Sexual minorities get more respects and recognasition from public, their mental health thus get more improvement, there is no doudt that for them no need to drink alcohol uncontrollably or commit a crime in order to decrease mental stress. As a result, social environment becomes better.

To achieve this autonomy, powerful algorithms, engineering, and computers will be required. Currently, all self-driving vehicles use various sensors such as LIDARS, lasers, and cameras to gather information about their surroundings. With this information, and with the help of machine learning, they are able to make decisions on how to get from point A to point B. With such modifications, it would be almost inappropriate to refer to them as cars, we should rather talk about computers with wheels.<br>And like any computer connected to a network, it is vulnerable. Not only is it vulnerable to security issues (meaning an entity could take control of your car, as it was proven in 2019 by Amat Cama and Richard Zhu when they hacked a telsa by taking advantage of a flaw in the car&#x27;s built-in internet browser), but it&#x27;s also vulnerable in other interesting ways. As mentioned earlier, self-driving cars currently rely on computer vision algorithms trained from millions of hours of driving. Like any machine learning model, they are biased, which means they can be exploited in some weir ways. For example, in February 2020, hackers were able to get Tesla cars to reach 85 mph instead of the normal 35 mph, simply by taping off the speed sign a bit, to transform the 3 into an 8. We could also talk about how they sometimes confuse Burger King signs for stop signs, but I find it more interesting to talk about another aspect of security, privacy. In order to continuously evolve, self-driving cars record an absurd amount of data, such as itineraries, location, user inputs... The use of this data is currently not well regulated in most countries, and this data could be used maliciously, by insurers, governments or even terrorists. Also, you may have noticed it, but data leaks are becoming more common, and this puts users at risk far beyond car accidents (such as identity thef). That&#x27;s why this house believes it&#x27;s too early for autonomous vehicles.&nbsp;<br><br><br><u>Argument Mingliang:</u> Legal and ethical dimensions<br><br>There is a very famous &#x27;tram dilemma&#x27;, which is a metaphor for the fact that humans, as highly intelligent beings, will make choices that are more in line with their own moral standards when a moral dilemma arises. Immediately afterwards, some media outlets began to ask questions about autonomous driving. Let&#x27;s say you are in a self-driving car driving down a wide, high-speed road and 10 people appear ahead of you. At this point the Autopilot system calculates that even if it brakes it will still inevitably hit the pedestrians in front of you, and it also calculates that quickly adjusting the front of the car to hit the adjacent barrier will effectively reduce the speed of the car and save the lives of the pedestrians in front of you, but may endanger you in the vehicle. What choice will the Autopilot make at this point?<br><br><u>Argument Ying: </u>Autonomous Cars are very expensive, equally fewer job opportunities for people<br><br>High-technology vehicles and equipment are expensive. They prepare a large amount of money for research and development as well as in choosing the finest and most functional materials needed such as the software, modified vehicle parts, and sensors. Thus, the cost of having Autonomous cars is initially higher. However, this may lower down after 10 years giving way for the average earner people to have one.<br><br>Besides, as the artificial intelligence continues to overcome the roles and responsibilities of humans, taxi, trucks, or even co-pilots may be laid off as their services will no longer be needed. This may significantly impact the employment rate and economic growth of a certain country.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, If we introduce a large number of autonomous cars, it will cause a vicious circle: A large number of people loss their job such as drivers, this will rusult in poverty of society,&nbsp; therefore the poor people can not afford the expensive expenses to buy the autonomous cars.<br><br>
