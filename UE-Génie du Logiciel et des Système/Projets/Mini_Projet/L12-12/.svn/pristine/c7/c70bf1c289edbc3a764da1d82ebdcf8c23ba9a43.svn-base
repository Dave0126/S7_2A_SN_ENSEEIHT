Guohao:
    Hello, Chaima! I uploaded all my works to SVN. You could download and check it. 
    
    So far, except for exercise 8, 9 and 10 in TP2 and exercise 2 and 3 in TP3, I have completed the rest. 
    
    My principle problem is that I do not know how to switch the simplePDL model to PetriNet. Could you handle it?
    
    Si non, we can upload these things we worked and ask the prof for a help.
    
    Bon weekend!

    Hey Chaima! I've committed my works on svn. There is a list as below :
    
    1. Delete   simplePDL/NewOCLFile.ocl
    
    2. Update   simplePDL/simplePDL.ocl, 
                simplePDL/Process1.xmi (Process.xmi is been removed),
                simplePDL/Process1-ko.xmi (process1-ko.xmi is been removed),
                PetriNet/PetriNet1.xmi (PetriNet.xmi is been removed)
        
    3.Add       PetriNet/PetriNet1-ko.xmi
    
    BTW, I did find the file simplePDL2PetriNet.java which you said in your message.
    
    And I notice that you changed someting in document fr.n7.simplePDL.editor, I didn't change it
    
    in this version I commited. You can update based on this version.
    
    Wish you have a good weekend!

    Hey Chaima! How are you? 
    
    tp08: I have already finished, you could check "fr.n7.simplepdl2petrinet" and "SinplePDL2PetriNet.xmi" in "fr.n7.petriNet"
    
    Ne pas encore faire:
    
    tp07: Exercice 4.5 : to finish "ex1.pdl" in the document fr.n7.simplePDL.exemples
    
    tp06: at the end of this tp, we can not create Guidances and WSEdges between the nodes by clicking. but the prof said maybe it is the problem of eclipse ...
    
    tp05: exercice 4. I have done "fr.n7.petrinet.toTina" and "fr.n7.petrinet.toTina.ui". but they don't work
    
    tp04: maybe we finished, but I am not sure...
    
    tp03: maybe we finished, but I am not sure...
    
    tp02: maybe we finished, but I am not sure...
