Cher Prof.

    This is Guohao, a international student in L2-2SN. I uploaded all my works to SVN. You could download and check it. 
    
    So far, except for exercise 8, 9 and 10 in TP2 and exercise 2 and 3 in TP3, I have completed the rest. 
    
    My principle problem is that I do not know how to switch the simplePDL model to PetriNet. 
    
    Could you mind helping me to handle it if it is possible?
    
    Bon weekend!
    
    Guohao
