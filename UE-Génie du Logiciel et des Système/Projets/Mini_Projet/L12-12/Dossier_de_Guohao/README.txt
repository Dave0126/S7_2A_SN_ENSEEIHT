    Hello, Chaima! I uploaded all my works to SVN. You could download and check it. 
    
    So far, except for exercise 8, 9 and 10 in TP2 and exercise 2 and 3 in TP3, I have completed the rest. 
    
    My principle problem is that I do not know how to switch the simplePDL model to PetriNet. Could you handle it?
    
    Si non, we can upload these things we worked and ask the prof for a help.
    
    Bon weekend!
